## How to run the code
### Map Coloring Problem
Go to *test_CSP.py* and you will see the this driver code to run the CSP for map coloring problem:

```
test_map_coloring_oz(MRV=True, DH=True, LCV=True, AC3=True)
test_map_coloring_usa(MRV=True, DH=True, LCV=True, AC3=True)
```

with MRV, DH, LCV and AC3 as boolean values indicating the utilization of such heuristic (MRV, DH, LCV) and inference (AC3) in the algorithm. You can change the value into either True/False for all these variables to activate/deactivate it from the algorithm.

### Circuit Board Layout Problem

I did not do this problem because I do not understand how to frame the problem.
